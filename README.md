# Data Mining for Educational 

This project focuses on using data mining techniques to predict student dropout, classify schools based on performance, and evaluate the performance of different classification algorithms.

## Objectives

- Develop a classification model to predict student dropout based on academic performance and attendance data.
- Classify schools into high-performing, average, and low-performing categories based on standardized test scores and resource availability.
- Evaluate the performance of different classification algorithms on the student data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11.9
- Vscode

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries by running the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv base && source base/bin/activate
``


```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```


```bash
run the main.ipynb jupyter notebook
